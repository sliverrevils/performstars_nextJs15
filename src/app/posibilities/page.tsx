                            The set of basic algorithms developed by us recognize the trajectory of movement on any static billiard video with an efficiency of up to 95%. The novelty lies in the fact that our system works equally effectively in a very wide range of operating conditions, from a conventional smartphone to professional cameras. Unlike existing algorithms that impose very strict
                            initial requirements on the quality of the incoming video and work effectively only for strictly verified, calibrated conditions.
